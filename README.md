# TopDownShooter
This project was inspired by games similar to The Legend of Zelda and The Binding of Isaac. My main goal with this project was to expand on basic 2D movement and introduce myself into enemy AI.

In the game, there are twelve rooms. The first two serve as tutorial rooms. Each of the next nine rooms contain a different assortment of enemies except for one which contains a treasure chest. The last room is a boss room.

Builds for PC, MAC, and Linux are available in the "Builds" folder.
